# **Workout Tracker** - [![License: WTFPL](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-WTFPL-brightgreen.svg)](http://www.wtfpl.net/about/)
    
**Workout Tracker** is an application used to view create and track daily workouts. The user is able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day, and track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, the user will be able to track distance traveled. For the assignment, I was already provided with most of the front-end code. The focus of this assignment was the creation of a Mongo database with Mongoose schema and APIroutes.
